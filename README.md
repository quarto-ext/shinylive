Shinylive Quarto extension
==========================

This extension lets you embed [Shinylive](https://shiny.rstudio.com/py/docs/shinylive.html) applications in a Quarto document. These are [Shiny for Python](https://shiny.rstudio.com/py/) applications which run completely in the browser, using [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) (Python compiled to WebAssembly).

This repository contains an example Quarto document which uses this extension:

* Usage example: [source](index.qmd) | [rendered web page](https://quarto-ext.github.io/shinylive/)
* Sine wave example: [source](sine.qmd) | [rendered web page](https://quarto-ext.github.io/shinylive/sine.html)
* File-loading example: [source](load_file.qmd) | [rendered web page](https://quarto-ext.github.io/shinylive/load_file.html)

## Installation

Prerequisites:
* Quarto. You can download it [here](https://quarto.org/docs/download/).
* If using R for your Shiny apps in your Quarto document: a recent version of [`shinylive`](https://github.com/rstudio/r-shinylive) R package, which can be installed with:
    ```
    install.packages("shinylive")
    ```
* If using Python for your Shiny apps in your Quarto document: a recent version of [`shinylive`](https://github.com/rstudio/py-shinylive) Python package, which can be installed with:
    ```
    pip install shinylive --upgrade
    ```

To use this extension in your Quarto project, run this in the top level of your Quarto project:

```bash
quarto add quarto-ext/shinylive
```

This will install the extension under the `_extensions/` subdirectory. If you're using version control, you will want to check in this directory.


## Usage

Put this in the header of your document, or in the `_quarto.yml` file:

```yaml
filters:
  - shinylive
```

Then you can put the code for a Shiny application in a code block marked with `{shinylive-python}`.


````markdown
---
title: Shinylive in Quarto example
format: html
filters:
  - shinylive
---

This is a Shinylive application embedded in a Quarto doc.

```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true

from shiny import *

app_ui = ui.page_fluid(
    ui.input_slider("n", "N", 0, 100, 40),
    ui.output_text_verbatim("txt"),
)

def server(input, output, session):
    @output
    @render.text
    def txt():
        return f"The value of n*2 is {input.n() * 2}"

app = App(app_ui, server)

```
````

Note that the code block currently must have `#| standalone: true`, which indicates that the code represents a complete Shiny application, as opposed to one which has parts spread throughout the document (which will be supported in the future).


### Other options


By default, a Shinylive code block will run the application by itself. It is also possible to also display the code in an editor. The editor is "live" -- it allows the user can make changes to the code and re-run the application.

To do this, you need to tell it which `components` to display:

```
#| components: [editor, viewer]
```

 ![Editor and viewer](editor-viewer.png)


By default, it will just display the app `viewer`, without the code `editor`.


******

When showing the editor and viewer, the default is to display the editor panel on the left and the application viewer panel on the right. They can be arranged vertically, with the editor above the app viewer, with:

```
#| layout: vertical
```

 ![Editor and viewer, vertical arrangement](editor-viewer-vertical.png)


******

You can control the height of the panel by setting `viewerHeight`:

```
#| viewerHeight: 420
```

******

If you want to have multiple files in your application, you can use `## file: filename` to indicate the start of each file. This can be used for any type of file, including `.py`, `.csv`, `requirements.txt`, or even binary files.

````markdown
```{shinylive-python}
#| standalone: true
#| components: [editor, viewer]
## file: app.py
from shiny import App, ui render
from utils import square

# [App code here...]

## file: utils.py

def square(x, n):
    row = ui.div([x] * n)
    return ui.div([row] * n)

## file: requirements.txt
shinyswatch

## file: www/logo.png
## type: binary
iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACgAAA ...
```

````

******

If you want an application which loads data files, you can either embed them in the application with `## file: xyz.dat`, or you can add the file as a separate file in the web site, and load it via a URL. See the [file-loading example](https://quarto-ext.github.io/shinylive/load_file.html) ([source](load_file.qmd)) for an example of how to do this.


******

The default width in a Quarto document is somewhat narrow for showing the editor and viewer next to each other. It can be made wider with [Quarto layout containers](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/article-layout.html). For example, `column-screen-inset` will the app take up almost the whole window width:

````markdown
:::{.column-screen-inset}
```{shinylive-python}
